    <h1>Rogue's Hot Takes 2023</h1>
    <p>We have the hottest takes this year.</p>
<div class="take-superpower">
    <h2>Superpower: Flying or Invisibility</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hot-takes/invisibility.jpg" alt="Two empty benches">
      <figcaption>Invisible me sitting on a bench; I'm waving.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Being invisible is better than flying because if you're invisible you can still fly in a plane. But if you can fly, there's nothing that you can do to become invisible.

    <h2>Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hot-takes/winter.jpg" alt="A misty, snowy morning">
      <figcaption>The winter sometimes looks like a painting.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Winter is <em>clearly</em> the best season. You can always get warmer in the winter, but it's hard to get cooler in the summer. Plus snow is awesome. And my birthday is in the winter!
    </p>

    <h2>Snacks: Potato Chips or Cookies</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hot-takes/potato-chips.jpg" alt="A bunch of potato chips">
      <figcaption>Salt and vinegar is the best.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Potato chips are smaller than cookies, so you can eat more of them in a single sitting. Also, they are good when added to other foods like sandwiches and hot dogs. But potato chips taste good also when added to sweet foods like Reece's peanutbutter cups. Adding cookies to savory foods doesn't work as well.

    <h2>Scenes: Mountainsor Ocean</h2>

      <img src="img/hot-takes/mountain.jpg" alt="A cloud laden mountain">
      <figcaption>Mt Ascutney is a monadnock and it's my home.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Mountains are so cool. Some of them come from volcanic activity, like Mt Ascutney, one of my neighborhood mountains. They are fun to climb. At the summit you can see forever. And you are less likely to drown on a mountain.
